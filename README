only_once 
---------

This gem only lets a code block run once in every N seconds.

For example:

  > loop { OnlyOnce.in(3) { puts Time.now } }
  2011-07-31 10:29:02 +1000
  2011-07-31 10:29:05 +1000
  2011-07-31 10:29:08 +1000
  ...


Usage
-----

First, gem install 'only_once'.  OnlyOnce uses a text file to keep track of
the state and puts it in /tmp by default.  The file is locked during update
so you can safely use it from multiple threads.

  require 'only_once'
  
  OnlyOnce.use_file = 'only_once.db'
  # or
  OnlyOnce.use_path = '/tmp/'


Caller Context
--------------

OnlyOnce looks at the ruby stack to know where its being called from, so you
can use it in different places in the same program.

Sometimes you may set the context manually using with_context().  You can
re-use the same context in different places in your program, for example to
make sure warning emails of any kind are only sent once every 2 minutes, eg:

  OnlyOnce.with_context('email alert').in(120) { EmailAlert.deliver ... }
